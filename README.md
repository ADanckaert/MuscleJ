# MuscleJ

Thank you for your interest in our development MuscleJ which, we hope, will be useful to the scientific community.

We are finalizing a new GitHub dedicated to the corresponding plugin MuscleJ with a set of data, new functionalities and a new tutorial.

While waiting for access to this plugin, you can download the macro MuscleJ_1_0_2 published in Skeletal Muscle Journal (Mayeuf-Louchart et al. Skeletal Muscle (2018) 8:25). 

You can find also the associated tutorial which should help you to understand this macro.

Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any trouble to use this macro with your data set.

And of course your feedback/comments/citation will be appreciated to improve this macro.

Best regards

Drs  Anne Danckaert and Alicia Mayeuf-Louchart
